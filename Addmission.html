    <h1> Office of Admissions üè´</h1>
Welcome to the Office of Admissions! Our goal is to find curious and dedicated students who are ready to contribute to our vibrant campus community. We use a holistic review process, which means we look at more than just your grades and test scores. We want to understand who you are, what you're passionate about, and what you'll bring to our university.
<br>
<b>Application Components</b>
To give us a full picture of your potential, we require the following from all applicants:
<br>
<b>Online Application Form:</b> This is the starting point for all prospective students. It collects your personal information, academic history, and intended major.
<br>
<b>
Official Transcripts:</b> We require official high school or prior university transcripts. These provide a record of your academic performance, courses taken, and GPA. We also consider the rigor of your coursework, such as Honors, AP, or IB classes.
<br>
<b>Personal Statement/Essay:</b> This is your chance to let your voice shine! Tell us your story, explain your motivations for studying your chosen field, or describe a significant challenge you overcame. We want to see your unique personality, critical thinking skills, and passion for learning.
<br>
<b>Letters of Recommendation:</b> We require one letter from a teacher and one from a school counselor. These letters should provide insight into your character, academic abilities, and how you engage in the classroom and school community.
<br>
<b>Extracurricular Activities & Achievements:</b> Your activities outside of the classroom show us your interests and commitment. We encourage you to list any clubs, sports, volunteer work, or jobs you've held. This section helps us understand your time management skills and what you'll contribute to campus life.
<br>
<b>Standardized Test Scores (Optional):</b> We have a test-optional policy, meaning you can choose whether or not to submit your SAT or ACT scores. If you feel your scores reflect your academic ability, feel free to submit them. If not, your application will be evaluated based on the other materials.

<h4>Admission Process</h4>
<b>Application Submission:</b> All materials must be submitted online by the application deadline.
<br>
<b>Application Review:</b> Our admissions committee carefully reviews each application, considering all components equally. We look for students who have challenged themselves academically, demonstrated a genuine curiosity for their field of study, and shown potential for growth.
<br>
<b>Interview (by invitation):</b> A select number of applicants will be invited for an interview with an admissions officer or a faculty member from their prospective department. This is a chance for us to learn more about you in person and for you to ask us questions.
<br>
<b>Decision Notification:</b> You will be notified of our decision by the date specified in our admissions timeline. We offer three possible outcomes: Admit, Waitlist, or Deny.

We're excited to learn about you and your potential to join our university!
