                 privilege for me to lead this prestigious institute which has a rich history of its distinction in teaching,
                  research and service to the nation.  whose 
                  foundation stone has been laid by the former prime minister, Rambaran in the year 2003.
                   Over a period of more than two decades, UoR has emerged as one of the leading institutions in
                    engineering and technology. Warangal is the second largest city of the state of Uttar pradesh being 
                    the first one which has several places of interest to visit. Some of the cultural heritages worth seeing in

                      ambience for nurturing innovation, incubation, creativity and excellence within its faculty and students

     y research and development for the benefit of Industry and Society.University of Rajabaran becomes a preferred institution for
     top rankers in Joint Entrance Examination (Main) because of its excellent teaching learning process, infrastructure 
     that a student needs for effective learning. Our alumni have received distinguished recognitions in their chosen areas
     of profession and extend support towards sustainable development of the institute. I invite participation of all 
     the stakeholders in
                 the growth plan of the institute to steer it to the next level of success in all fronts. </h4>
